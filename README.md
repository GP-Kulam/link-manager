## _Recorded Classes’ Link Manager._

### Description
As we all know that the world is undergoing unprecedented times and almost all the schools and colleges have become virtual and students are taught using varied technologies like Google Meet and Zoom. 
These classes are often **recorded** so that students can again access them for their revision. But at times **managing the links of these recorded classes** becomes tiresome for the teachers and students also face difficulties while trying to find a particular lecture.
Our Project aims at creating a **web application** which will be able to store all the links of the recorded classes subject wise for a particular institute. In this application, the teacher will be able to log into the system and then be able to add or delete the links of his classes, and hence it will be easier for the students to find all the links in a particular place. The teachers will also be able to add the description of the topics which were taught in the class in front of the links.<br> This will also be convenient for the teachers because they will not have to send the links in the WhatsApp groups which creates a chaos and is hard to maintain. The links can be varied and can be to the video that has been uploaded on YouTube or to a video that has been uploaded to the Google Drive.
